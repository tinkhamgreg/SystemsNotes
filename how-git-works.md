#Github Notes

	While I have used git before for version control in a group Android Studio project, I have not done anything in git besides create and copy repositories, create new branches, and merge branches a few times. For this reason I am not terribly familiar with what other functionality git may have. It may be the case that git only gets more advanced in the ways branching and repositories are used, or that there are other functions entirely. Because of this I'll start my search for advanced git tutorials and see if the topics that come up are too far out of my knowledge reach at this point.
	After a quick google search I came accross [Atlassion.com](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/advanced-overview), which covers topics such as merging and rebasing, resetting, checking out, and reverting, the use of git hooks, and using the advanced git log. For the purposes of this assignment I think I'll focus on merging and rebasing, resetting, checking out, and reverting. This way I start with something I'm familiar with and expand from there.
	Git merging and rebasing are used for different ways to add commits to a project. If you have two people who have copied a repository, of say our notes project from class, then the two people can edit the original piece on their own branches, and then merge their new additions with the original base one at a time. In the command line you can do this by either using the command "git checkout feature git merge master" to merge your branch with the master, or, use gits "feature" function which tells git that the two branches should be combined. 
	Rebasing is not as straightforward or common as merging. Rebasing is used when an individual wishes to combine "all of the commits in master onto the tip of feature" [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing). This only occurs in the repository of the person who ran the rebase command. So, everyone elses master branch stays the same. This can be very helpful if a person is completing a heavy workload by themselves with lots of commits and no one else will be affected by the rebasing. If there is a situation where a lot of branches are being made with tiny changes all from one master, there is no point of rebasing your own branch as you will be consistenly merging all of the branches with the master.
	Git reset, checkout, and revert all deal with going backwards in commits. The reset command will send the current commit back however many commits one wishes to go. So, if you've made 3 commits to a branch and you want your current commit to rewrite the first, you would use the command "git checkout (filename) git reset HEAD-2". Git checkout is actually a command I forgot I have used in the past. You use it when you want to switch the active git commit you're using. Let's say in your branch you have two different ideas for a project going on. In order to use one or the other you will have to check them out. You can also checkout commits in the past. A command such as "git checkout filename2" would checkout filename2 if you have filename3 checked out currently. The git revert command is not one I am familiar with, but upon research does not act in a way a person would intuitively think. What I mean by this is most people would assume that reverting to a past commit would simply make the latest commit whatever commit you wished to revert to. Git accomplishes this by creating a new commit based on taking the current commit and undoing all of the changes back to the version you wish to revert to.
